    "When a linear transformation is applied to a vector, the vector usually changes both its direction and magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are special vectors for whom the transformation acts such that their direction is preserved, and only the magnitude changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These special directions are called eigenvectors, and the corresponding scaling factors are called eigenvalues.\n"
